# Analysis of Pyber Data

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to show ride sharing data by the different types and to create visuals to better understand and analyze the data. We found that urban areas had the highest number of drivers, rides taken, and highest total fares. Suburban areas were next highest in totals, with rural areas having the least amount of drivers and rides, but the highest average fares out of the three.

## Results

Using the chart below to visualize the overall state of ride sharing in the different areas, we can see that Urban areas are the biggest money maker of the three, with rural trailing far below both Urban and Suburban areas.

The chart also shows that fares are relatively steady from months January to May with small spikes and dips along the way. 

Looking at our summarized data in our dataframe we can see that while our urban areas have the highest total out of all of our main categories (number of drivers, rides, and fares), rural areas have a much higher average fare per driver and average fare per ride. This could be that being a rural area, locations are further apart and require further travel but we cannot be sure without distance-per-ride data, which is not available at this time.

### Conclusions From the Data

* Rural areas generate the highest average fare
* Urban areas generate the highest overall fare
* Urban area customers pay less per ride than rural customers
* Suburban customers pay a more less average fare when compared to Urban and Rural customer fares


## Summary

* To get a better understanding of the overall business we should gather data from the rest of the months to compare with.

* While customers in rural areas generate the highest average fare for the company, this could be from the lack of drivers available for the customer or longer distances traveled, leading to higher fees overall. More data would be needed to come to a more concrete conclusion, but finding a way to bring average fares down may incentivize more rides from customers which should see higher overall revenue from the rural areas. Adding more drivers for rural areas would almost certainly help with this. 

* Suburban areas would benefit from having more drivers as well, which would bring the average-fare-per-ride down and incentivize customers to use the ride sharing more often and may bring in new customers as well. 

* Urban areas may see an increase in profits if rates are raised slightly as these areas would most likely be the least affected by price increases. Data on number of riders with other modes of transportation, population density, and possibly average age of the population may help analyze whether rates should be raised and by how much.
